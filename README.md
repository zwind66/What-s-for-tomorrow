# What-s-for-tomorrow

The goal of this project is to develop an app that will help us better prepare for tomorrow's meal plan. The 'What to Eat for Tomrrow' app displays local weather conditions for the next day based on user input. Depending on the weather, users can choose to go out and find a restaurant or make their own food from a recipe. Users can select and save recipes according to their own needs. I believe that with this app, we can make it easy for our users to decide what to eat the next day.
